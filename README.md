# Statistical Analysis of Body Fat Measurements

## Context
This project was developed as part of a **group assignment** in the course **Statistical Reasoning** .  
The objective was to explore and analyze body fat percentage and body measurements using statistical methods implemented in R.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to apply statistical reasoning to analyze body fat measurements, summarize the dataset, visualize distributions, and study relationships between key variables such as age, weight, height, and body density.

## Dataset
The analysis uses the **fat dataset** from the `faraway` R package.  
The dataset contains:
- 252 observations  
- 18 variables including body fat percentage, age, weight, height, body density, and body measurements  

## Methodology
- Data loading and exploration using R  
- Identification of variable types and dataset structure  
- Frequency tables for integer and numeric variables  
- Descriptive statistics (mean and median)  
- Implementation of custom statistical functions  
- Random sampling from the population  
- Data visualization using bar plots, histograms, pie charts, boxplots, and scatter plots  

## Statistical Analysis
Key statistical concepts applied include:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median)  
- Comparison between population and sample statistics  
- Interpretation of distributions and central tendency  
- Analysis of relationships between variables (e.g., height and weight)  

## Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- Bar plots for discrete variables (age)  
- Histograms for continuous variables (density, age)  
- Pie charts for sampled height data  
- Boxplots for weight distribution  
- Scatter plots to study the relationship between height and weight  
These visualizations support interpretation and statistical reasoning.

## Files 
- `Fat.Rmd` – R Markdown file containing the full analysis and code  
- `Fat.docx` – Written analytical report with results and interpretations  

## Tools and Technologies
- R  
- R Markdown  
- `faraway` package  

## Results
The analysis provides insights into:
- Body fat distribution and variability  
- Differences between population-level and sample-level statistics  
- Relationships between variables  
- The importance of statistical reasoning in interpreting real-world health data
